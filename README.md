### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I love learning and I see coding as an artform. I enjoy coming up with lots of ideas and designing them.

## Teaching
I really enjoy teaching and writing courses. Check out [Your First RPG](https://yourfirstrpg.com) and learn how to make your own RPG game in JavaScript today.

## Software Development 
I'm really passionate about expanding my capabilities as a programmer, and Javascript has been a great tool for that. I am constantly developing open source software in hopes that it can both accelerate the development process for myself and others.

If you'd like to see my most mature JS library please check out [Sandhands](https://github.com/L1lith/Sandhands) ðŸ˜Š
 
 ## Game Design
 It's hard to not hum along to the old zelda soundtracks. I feel like gaming has become so industrialized we forget to treat it as an art form. I enjoyed reading "Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life" and learning about how Japanese people revolutionized gaming.

## Web Development
I love seeing the many layers of modern software design, and staying with the cutting edge. In the past I have enjoyed developing isomorphic apps built with React. Lately I've been working with Gatsby, but I'm always interested in new frameworks.

## Security
I enjoy understanding all the different aspects of the code I work on, so I study cyber security to better understand the security aspects of back-end & front-end development, as well as the numerous capabilities and potential vulnerabilities of cloud services like AWS and Lambda.
