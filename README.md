# Nice to meet you
I love making art. To know more about me check out [my website](https://webslc.com). I also have [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Purp1) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/oslilith/) where you can find AI artwork and more.

## Areas I've explored

### Teaching
Learning to teach enables me to share my knowledge, and help me consolidate my understanding of code. If you would like to learn JavaScript, feel free to check out [Your First RPG](https://yourfirstrpg.com), a course I'm currently working on.

### Software Development 
I'm really passionate about expanding my capabilities as a programmer, and Javascript has been a great tool for that. I am constantly developing open source software in hopes that it can both accelerate the development process for myself and others.

### Game Design
 It's hard to not hum along to the old zelda soundtracks. I feel like gaming has become so industrialized we forget to treat it as an art form. I enjoyed reading *"Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life"* and learning about how Japanese people revolutionized gaming. I also redid the website for the amazing open source game engine [melonJS](https://melonjs.org)

### Web Development
I love seeing the many layers of modern software design, and exploring the cutting edge. I've worked with a lot of tools, but [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [Astro](https://astro.build/) to me are simply unmatched for lightning fast web pages.

### Security
I enjoy making things safe, so I study cyber security to better understand the security aspects of back-end & front-end development, as well as potential security risks in cloud-based environments like AWS and Lambda.
