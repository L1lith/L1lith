### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a knowledge enthusiast and I see coding as an artform. 

#### ~ Vectors of Approach ~

## Teaching
I really enjoy teaching and writing courses. Check out my intro course to JS [here](https://yourfirstrpg.com) and learn how to make your own RPG today.

## Software Development 
I'm really passionate about expanding my capabilities as a programmer, and Javascript has been a great tool for that. I am constantly developing open source software in hopes that it can both accelerate the development process for myself and others.

 ## Game Design
 It's hard to not hum along to the old zelda soundtracks. I feel like gaming has become so industrialized we forget to treat it as an art form. I'm currently working on a secret project, but I can't wait to share it when it's ready!

## Web Development
I love seeing the many layers of modern software design, and staying with the cutting edge. In the past I have enjoyed developing isomorphic apps built with Next.js and React. Lately I've been learning feathers.js in order to build real-time applications. 

## Security
I enjoy understanding all the different aspects of the code I work on, so I study cyber security to better understand the security aspects of back-end & front-end development, as well as the numerous capabilities and potential vulnerabilities of cloud services like AWS and Lambda.
