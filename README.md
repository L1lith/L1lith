# Nice to meet you
I enjoy eurika moments, working on projects. To know more about me check out [my website](https://webslc.com).

## Areas I've explored

### Teaching
Learning to teach enables me to share my knowledge, and help me consolidate my understanding of code. If you would like to learn JavaScript, feel free to check out [Your First RPG](https://yourfirstrpg.com), a course I'm currently working on.

### Software Development 
I'm really passionate about expanding my capabilities as a programmer, and Javascript has been a great tool for that. I am constantly developing open source software in hopes that it can both accelerate the development process for myself and others.

### Game Design
 It's hard to not hum along to the old zelda soundtracks. I feel like gaming has become so industrialized we forget to treat it as an art form. I enjoyed reading *"Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life"* and learning about how Japanese people revolutionized gaming. I'm currently developing a game using [Melon.js](https://melonjs.org/)

### Web Development
I love seeing the many layers of modern software design, and exploring the cutting edge. I've worked with a lot of tools, but lately Solid.js has been my favorite tool for lightning fast web pages.

### Security
I enjoy making things safe, so I study cyber security to better understand the security aspects of back-end & front-end development, as well as potential security risks in cloud-based environments like AWS and Lambda.
