### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a learning enthusiast. I like to set goals new years style, like "just learn all the parts of coding that interest me". Pretty sure I'm stuck with that one forever.

#### Vectors of Attack
## Software Development
I'm really passionate about expanding my capabilities as a programmer, and Javascript has been a great tool for that. Currently I'm starting an adventure in meta-programming ([found here](https://github.com/L1lith/Emerald-Templates)), in order to create a more flexible tool for flushing out projects quickly.

 
 ## Game Design
 It's hard to not hum along to the old zelda soundtracks. I feel like gaming has become so industrialized we forget to treat it as an art form. I'm currently working on a secret project, but I can't wait to share it when it's ready!

## Web Development & Security
I love seeing the many layers of modern software design, and staying with the cutting edge. I love the ease of deployment and the isomorphic nature of apps built with Next.js and React. 

## Security
I enjoy understanding all the different aspects of the code I work on, so I study cyber security to better understand the security aspects of back-end & front-end development, as well as the numerous capabilities and potential vulnerabilities of cloud services like AWS and Lambda.
