### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a learning enthusiast. I like to set goals new years style, like "just learn all the parts of coding that interest me". Pretty sure I'm stuck with that one forever.

## Teaching
I really enjoy teaching and writing courses. Check out my intro course to JS [here](https://github.com/L1lith/Intro-Coding-Concepts/)

## Software Development 
I'm really passionate about expanding my capabilities as a programmer, and Javascript has been a great tool for that. I am constantly developing open source software in hopes that it can both accelerate the development process for myself and others.

If you'd like to see my most mature JS library please check out [Sandhands](https://github.com/L1lith/Sandhands) ðŸ˜Š
 
 ## Game Design
 It's hard to not hum along to the old zelda soundtracks. I feel like gaming has become so industrialized we forget to treat it as an art form. I'm currently working on a secret project, but I can't wait to share it when it's ready!

## Web Development
I love seeing the many layers of modern software design, and staying with the cutting edge. In the past I have enjoyed developing isomorphic apps built with Next.js and React. Lately I've been learning feathers.js in order to build real-time applications. 

## Security
I enjoy understanding all the different aspects of the code I work on, so I study cyber security to better understand the security aspects of back-end & front-end development, as well as the numerous capabilities and potential vulnerabilities of cloud services like AWS and Lambda.
